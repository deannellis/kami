# kami

> ðŸ“ƒ A minimal front-end starter for your next project

## My goal with kami was threefold:
- To create a boilerplate project for future React applications
- To capture UI patterns I have implemeneted many times and provide a base design system that is easily adpated
- To try new technologies & best practices
